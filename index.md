## About
I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley, majoring in Computer Science. I'm an Academic Intern for the UC Berkeley EECS department, assisting students in the CS department's discrete mathematics course, CS 70. Aside from CS, my interests include math, debate and writing; I participated extensively in Model United Nations competitions in high school, and I am the Secretary of Operations and Technology of Jakarta Students' Congress, the largest student-run Model Congress conference in Indonesia. I'm excited to be participating in collegiate MUN from this year onward!
