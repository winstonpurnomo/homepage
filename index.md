## About
I'm a sophomore at UC Berkeley, intending to declare Computer Science. I'm an Academic Intern for the UC Berkeley EECS department, assisting students from the largest on-campus class at UC Berkeley, CS61A. Aside from CS, my interests include math, debate and writing; I participated extensively in Model United Nations competitions in high school, and I am the Secretary of Operations and Technology of Jakarta Students' Congress, the largest student-run Model Congress conference in Indonesia. I'm excited to be participating in collegiate MUN from this year onward!
